## REQUIREMENTS
* The demo will be tested on the builded apk file.
* Project name Should be Hexagon+YourName. Example: “HexagonBuket”
* The core mechanic should be provided: Select a hexagonal group and turn them clockwise or counterclockwise. If a 3-hexagonal group of the same color occurs, they should be exploded, if not the hexagonal pieces should return to the initial state.
* The game grid should be changeable from the editor easily. The default grid is 8x9.
* Colors and color count of the hexagons should also be changeable from the editor easily. By default, there are 5 colors.
* Scoring is 5 times the exploded block count.
* A bomb hexagon should appear on every 1000 score. The bomb’s function is to count from a number every time an action is made on the board. When the number reaches zero, a bomb explodes and the game is lost. You can check the example game given to understand this requirement better.
* The game is over when there are no more available moves left or a bomb explodes.
* You are allowed to use 3rd party assets of your choice.
* The demo should contain these elements:
* Core mechanic(this includes colors of the hexagons)
    * Grid system
    * Scoring
    * Bomb hexagon
    * Game over logic

Your project will be reviewed on these conditions, please read carefully:
* Clean, reusable, modular code.
